# civicrm-buildkit

Buildkit is a collection of ~20 tools for developing and testing CiviCRM.
These tools are referenced in the CiviCRM developer documentation.

Many of these tools are commonly used by web developers, so you may have
already installed a few.  Even so, it's generally easier to download the
full collection &mdash; installing each individually takes a lot of work.

This is the same collection of tools which manages the test/demo/release
infrastructure for civicrm.org.

## Download

* [Full Download: Ubuntu](doc/download-ubuntu.md) - Download buildkit and all system dependencies (mysql, etc). This is ideal when setting up a new, clean Ubuntu host.
* [Full Download: Vagrantbox](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-buildkit-vagrant) - Download a prepared virtual-machine with all system dependencies (mysql, etc). This is ideal if you work on Windows or OS X.
* [Manual Download](doc/download-manual.md) - Just download buildkit. This is ideal if you have already installed the system dependencies by some other means (CentOS, MAMP, etc).

After you've downloaded buildkit the first time, you should periodically [update the tools](doc/download-update.md).
